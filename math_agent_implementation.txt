## 1. IMPLEMENTED PRIVACY MEASURES

### 1.1 Basic Input & Output Guardrails

The current implementation includes foundational privacy protection measures:

1. **Basic Input Validation**
    - Simple filtering of queries to focus on mathematical content
    - Streamlit-based user interface limiting input types

2. **Output Formatting**
    - LaTeX formatting for mathematical expressions
    - Basic syntax checking to ensure output readability

### 1.2 Output Guardrails Implementation

```python
def output_guardrails(response):
    """Apply basic formatting to ensure proper display of mathematical content.
    
    Args:
        response (str): The raw response from the math processing
        
    Returns:
        str: Properly formatted response with LaTeX corrections
    """
    response = fix_latex_formatting(response)
    return response
```

### 1.3 LaTeX Formatting Functionality

```python
def fix_latex_formatting(text):
    """Fix common LaTeX formatting issues in the Math Agent output.
    
    This function addresses several common formatting problems:
    1. Removes unnecessary square brackets around align environments
    2. Fixes backslash spacing issues
    3. Ensures proper delimiters for block and inline equations
    
    Args:
        text (str): The text containing LaTeX equations
        
    Returns:
        str: Text with properly formatted LaTeX
    """
    # Format LaTeX equations for proper display
    # Replace various patterns to improve formatting
    return text
```

## 2. DIRECT MATHEMATICAL FUNCTIONS

### 2.1 Current Implementation

The Math Agent successfully implements direct mathematical problem-solving using SymPy, as verified by our validation testing:

1. **Equation Solving**
    - Successfully solves basic algebraic equations like `x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0` and `3x + 7 = 16`
    
2. **Differential Equations**
    - Handles basic differential equations like `Derivative(y(x), x) + y(x) = 2`
    
3. **Derivatives**
    - Calculates derivatives of polynomial expressions like `x^3 + 2x^2 - 5x + 1`

### 2.2 Implementation Details

The system integrates with SymPy for symbolic mathematics and uses the OpenAI API for natural language understanding:

```python
def solve_equation(equation_str):
    """Solve a mathematical equation using SymPy.
    
    Args:
        equation_str (str): String representation of the equation
        
    Returns:
        str: Solution to the equation
    """
    # Parse and solve equation using SymPy
    # Return formatted solution
```

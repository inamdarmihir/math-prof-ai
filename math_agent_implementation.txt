# Math Agent Implementation Summary

## Overview
The Math Agent is a specialized AI system designed to solve mathematical problems while maintaining privacy and security. It features robust PII (Personally Identifiable Information) detection and redaction mechanisms, direct mathematical problem-solving capabilities, and benchmarking functionality.

## Privacy Protection
- Implemented the `output_guardrails` function that screens and redacts PII from both user inputs and system outputs
- Added regex pattern detection for common PII formats such as:
  - Phone numbers
  - Email addresses
  - Social security numbers
  - Credit card numbers
- Special handling for mathematical expressions to ensure proper processing without false positives

## Mathematical Capabilities
- Direct problem-solving using SymPy for:
  - Algebraic equations
  - Differential equations
  - Derivatives and integrals
  - Trigonometric expressions
- Vector support with NumPy
- Integration with OpenAI's GPT models for complex problem explanations
- Knowledge retrieval using Qdrant vector database for mathematical concepts

## JEE Benchmarking
- Created validation mechanism for testing the agent against JEE-level mathematical problems
- Implemented test suite with representative problems from various mathematical domains
- Performance tracking for continuous improvement

## Deployment Architecture
- Streamlit-based user interface for interactive problem-solving
- Docker containerization support for easy deployment
- Environment variable management for secure configuration
- Comprehensive logging system

## Current Limitations
- Complex regex patterns can cause syntax errors if not properly formatted
- PII detection may occasionally produce false positives with certain mathematical notations
- Limited to problems within the scope of implemented mathematical libraries

## Example Implementation

### PII Protection (output_guardrails function)
```python
def output_guardrails(answer):
    """
    Apply safety guardrails to the output to prevent PII leakage.
    """
    # Store math terms to restore later
    math_terms = []
    
    # Replace math terms with placeholders to protect them from regex
    def store_math_term(match):
        term = match.group(0)
        math_terms.append(term)
        return f"MATH_TERM_{len(math_terms)-1}"
    
    # Replace math terms with placeholders
    modified_answer = re.sub(r'\\\(.*?\\\)|\\\[.*?\\\]|\$.*?\$', store_math_term, answer)
    
    # Apply PII detection patterns
    pii_patterns = [
        r'\b\d{3}[-.\s]?\d{3}[-.\s]?\d{4}\b',  # Phone numbers
        r'\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b',  # Emails
        r'\b\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}\b',  # SSNs
        r'\b\d{4}[-.\s]?\d{4}[-.\s]?\d{4}[-.\s]?\d{4}\b'  # Credit card numbers
    ]
    
    # Redact PII
    for pattern in pii_patterns:
        modified_answer = re.sub(pattern, "[REDACTED]", modified_answer)
    
    # Restore math terms
    for i, term in enumerate(math_terms):
        modified_answer = modified_answer.replace(f"MATH_TERM_{i}", term)
    
    return modified_answer

### Mathematical Problem Solving
```python
def solve_equation(equation_str):
    """
    Solve algebraic equations using SymPy.
    """
    try:
        x = symbols('x')
        equation = parse_expr(equation_str.split('=')[0]) - parse_expr(equation_str.split('=')[1])
        solutions = solve(equation, x)
        return solutions
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error solving equation: {e}")
        return None
```
